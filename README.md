Tired of installing your Minecraft server plugins by using your file manager? try this. its better, trust me.

## Requirements

  - A unix-like operating system that uses bash (shell) 
  - A Minecraft server. (duh) 
  - Literally any piece of hardware, if you're running a server, you can run this. 

## Installation 
- Installation is dead simple, download the latest release and open a terminal, type `./install.sh` and follow the prompts.
- Test a .JAR file to make sure it's working.
- NOTE: Your directory path should look something like this when entering it /server-folder and not like /server-folder/ or /server-folder/plugins.
- You may also need to give the script permission to run as an executable.
## Using the Script 
You can view the help command by using 
`
